#PRIVILEGE ESCALATION RESOURCES

#General:

https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings (*A bunch of tools and payloads for every stage of pentesting*)


#Linux:

https://blog.g0tmi1k.com/2011/08/basic-linux-privilege-escalation/ (*a bit old but still worth looking at*)

https://github.com/rebootuser/LinEnum (*One of the most popular priv esc scripts*)

https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration/blob/master/lse.sh (*Another popular script*)

https://github.com/mzet-/linux-exploit-suggester (*A Script that's dedicated to searching for kernel exploits*)

https://gtfobins.github.io (*I can not overstate the usefulness of this for priv esc, if a common binary has special permissions, you can use this site to see how to get root perms with it.*)


#Windows

https://www.fuzzysecurity.com/tutorials/16.html  (*Dictates some very useful commands and methods to enumerate the host and gain intel*)

https://github.com/PowerShellEmpire/PowerTools/tree/master/PowerUp (*A bit old but still an incredibly useful script*)

https://github.com/411Hall/JAWS (*A general enumeration script*)

# The Basics - Start Here
these are the resources I used to get more comfortable with linux, scripting, TCP/IP, etc. I recommend starting with these especially if you dont have much/any experience

# Metasploit 
although it has been said that Metasploit use is limited during the exam, Offensive Security recommends getting more familiar with Metasploit. I have been going through the metasploit unleashed course its really good info, i would be suprised if I dont have to come back to this repeatedly
